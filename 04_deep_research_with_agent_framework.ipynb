    "# **Deep Research with Agent Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an agentic research workflow using **Microsoft Agent Framework** to orchestrate a multi-agent system for comprehensive web-based research. Unlike notebooks 01-03, this implementation uses Agent Framework's workflow builder for more sophisticated agent coordination and routing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Workflow Orchestration** - Uses Agent Framework's WorkflowBuilder for declarative agent coordination\n",
    "- **Conditional Routing** - Implements switch-case logic for dynamic workflow paths based on peer review feedback\n",
    "- **Pure Azure AI Agents** - All agents pre-created in Azure AI Foundry (same as notebook 03)\n",
    "- **Automated Quality Control** - Peer review agent routes workflow to completion, revision, or data gathering\n",
    "- **Workflow Visualization** - Generates SVG diagrams of the agent workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Built with Microsoft Agent Framework, Azure AI Projects, and Azure AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
